# langchain-wikibase

This repository contains work on a langchain agent for question answering against a Wikidata or any local instance of Wikibase/Mediawiki.

We've added agents that can connect to locally running LLMs via Ollama, like Mixtral 70b and remote running via API like Google Gemini pro. Also, a simple chatbot user interface built with Gradio was added.

At present, this work is very preliminary, contributions are welcome!
